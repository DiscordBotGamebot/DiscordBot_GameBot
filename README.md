# DiscordBot_GameBot
@xCuZiMPr0 has an idea where a discord bot gets the current game of users in the server and verifies them, making sure that it isnt set to some custom text. After its verified it would be put into a database (MongoDB) and then managed/analyzed in some way via a web frontend with AdminLTE
